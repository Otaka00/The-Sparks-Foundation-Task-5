# The-Sparks-Foundation-Task-5
This repository represents my work for task 5 of the Sparks Foundation GRIP of Data Science and Business Analytics domain which is an exploratory data analysis of teams and matches in sports.
## Goals: 
- Try to find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team as a sports analyst
- Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products

Two Datasets files are imported in which one contains matches played across the season and the other contains the scores of the teams. I analysed the data using visualizations which determines top scorers of all teams, team that played most number of matches, Top 15 players of match winners and venues matches are hosted on and number of matches played each season.
